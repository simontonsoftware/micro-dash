/**
 * Sets the value at `path` of `object`. If a portion of `path` doesn't exist, it's created. Arrays are created for missing index properties while objects are created for all other missing properties.
 *
 * **Note:** This method mutates `object`.
 *
 * Differences from lodash:
 * - only accepts an array for `path`, not a dot-separated string
 * - does not handle `customizer` returning `undefined`
 *
 * Contribution to minified bundle size, when it is the only function imported:
 * - Lodash: 5,814 bytes
 * - Micro-dash: 201 bytes
