 * The opposite of `pickBy`; this method creates an object composed of the own enumerable string keyed properties of `object` that `predicate` doesn't return truthy for.
 *
 * Differences from lodash:
 * - does not treat sparse arrays as dense
 *
 * Contribution to minified bundle size, when it is the only function imported:
 * - Lodash: 15,528 bytes
 * - Micro-dash: 399 bytes
