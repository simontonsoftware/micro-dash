 * Checks if `n` is between `start` and up to, but not including, `end`. If start is greater than end the params are swapped to support negative ranges.

 * Differences from lodash:
 * - `start` and `end` are both required
 * - does not coerce falsey bounds to `0`
 *
 * Contribution to minified bundle size, when it is the only function imported:
 * - Lodash: 1,374 bytes
 * - Micro-dash: 59 bytes
